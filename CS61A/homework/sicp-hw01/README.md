## Required Questions

### Q1: A Plus Abs B

Fill in the blanks in the following function for adding `a` to the absolute value of `b`, without calling `abs`. You may **not** modify any of the provided code other than the two blanks.

```python
from operator import add, sub

def a_plus_abs_b(a, b):
    """Return a+abs(b), but without calling abs.

    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, 3)
    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, -3)
    5
    >>> # a check that you didn't change the return statement!
    >>> import inspect, re
    >>> re.findall(r'^\s*(return .*)', inspect.getsource(a_plus_abs_b), re.M)
    ['return f(a, b)']
    """
    if b < 0:
        f = _____
    else:
        f = _____
    return f(a, b)
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```shell
python3 ok -q a_plus_abs_b --local
```



### Q2: Two of Three

Write a function that takes three *positive* numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two smallest numbers. **Use only a single line for the body of the function.**

```python
def two_of_three(x, y, z):
    """Return a*a + b*b, where a and b are the two smallest members of the
    positive numbers x, y, and z.

    >>> two_of_three(1, 2, 3)
    5
    >>> two_of_three(5, 3, 1)
    10
    >>> two_of_three(10, 2, 8)
    68
    >>> two_of_three(5, 5, 5)
    50
    >>> # check that your code consists of nothing but an expression (this docstring)
    >>> # a return statement
    >>> import inspect, ast
    >>> [type(x).__name__ for x in ast.parse(inspect.getsource(two_of_three)).body[0].body]
    ['Expr', 'Return']
    """
    return _____
```

> **Hint:** Consider using the `max` or `min` function:
>
> ```python
> >>> max(1, 2, 3)
> 3
> >>> min(-1, -2, -3)
> -3
> ```

Use Ok to test your code:

```shell
python3 ok -q two_of_three --local
```



### Q3: Largest Factor

Write a function that takes an integer `n` that is **greater than 1** and returns the largest integer that is smaller than `n` and evenly divides `n`.

```python
def largest_factor(n):
    """Return the largest factor of n that is smaller than n.

    >>> largest_factor(15) # factors are 1, 3, 5
    5
    >>> largest_factor(80) # factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40
    40
    >>> largest_factor(13) # factor is 1 since 13 is prime
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> **Hint:** To check if `b` evenly divides `a`, you can use the expression `a % b == 0`, which can be read as, "the remainder of dividing `a` by `b` is 0."

Use Ok to test your code:

```shell
python3 ok -q largest_factor --local
```



### Q4: If Function vs Statement

Let's try to write a function that does the same thing as an `if` statement.

```python
def if_function(condition, true_result, false_result):
    """Return true_result if condition is a true value, and
    false_result otherwise.

    >>> if_function(True, 2, 3)
    2
    >>> if_function(False, 2, 3)
    3
    >>> if_function(3==2, 3+2, 3-2)
    1
    >>> if_function(3>2, 3+2, 3-2)
    5
    """
    if condition:
        return true_result
    else:
        return false_result
```

Despite the doctests above, this function actually does *not* do the same thing as an `if` statement in all cases. To prove this fact, write functions `cond`, `true_func`, and `false_func` such that `with_if_statement` prints the number `47`, but `with_if_function` prints both `42` and `47`.

```python
def with_if_statement():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_statement()
    47
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    if cond():
        return true_func()
    else:
        return false_func()

def with_if_function():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_function()
    42
    47
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    return if_function(cond(), true_func(), false_func())

def cond():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def true_func():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def false_func():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> **Hint**: If you are having a hard time identifying how an `if` statement and `if_function` differ, consider the [rules of evaluation for `if` statements](http://composingprograms.com/pages/15-control.html#conditional-statements) and [call expressions](http://composingprograms.com/pages/12-elements-of-programming.html#call-expressions).

Use Ok to test your code:

```shell
python3 ok -q with_if_statement --local
python3 ok -q with_if_function --local
```



### Q5: Hailstone

Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

1. Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process until `n` is 1.

The number `n` will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

This sequence of values of `n` is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name `n`, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at `n`, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:

```python
def hailstone(n):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at n and return its
    length.

    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Hailstone sequences can get quite long! Try 27. What's the longest you can find?

Use Ok to test your code:

```shell
python3 ok -q hailstone --local
```



## Doctest

Run the doctest of `hw01.py` like:

```shell
python3 -m doctest hw01.py
```

If nothing happened, you should pass all the doctests.
